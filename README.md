# Long-Jump for School - Desktop-application

## About
<p>This project was created privately and its purpose is to familiarize myself with Qt Creator, develop my C++ skills and implement them in such a project.</p>

## Functionality
<p>A sports teacher wants to introduce a grading system that also gives weaker pupils the chance to achieve a good sports grade.
At the beginning of the year, he records the pupils' performance in the long jump and enters the jump distance (jump 1) of each pupil in a list.</p>

<p>After 3 months of training, the performance test (jump 2) is repeated.</p>

<p>There are now 2 assessment options:</p>

<p>1. The grade is determined depending on the jump distance:</p>

|  Jump distance  |    Grade     |
|:---------------:|:------------:|
|  more than 5m   |      1       |
|  4.50 - 4.99m   |      2       |
|  4.00 - 4.49m   |      3       |
|  3.50 - 3.99m   |      4       |
